# Learning Backbone

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

Backbone.js is a library that you call, not a framework (like React/Angular) that calls you. Library: more flexibility. Framework: less boilerplate.

Backbone.js modules: Views. Events. Models. Collections. Routers.
